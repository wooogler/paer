      "content": "In the section titled \"Understanding technology use of minimalists,\" it seems you aim to explore how individuals who practice minimalism interact with technology. Here are some suggestions and considerations for this section:\n\n1. **Clarify Definitions**: Start with a brief definition of what minimalism is, emphasizing both lifestyle minimalism and digital minimalism. This will help readers understand the framework before diving into how technology is used or avoided.\n\n2. **Contextual Background**: Briefly explain the rise of minimalism in modern culture, potentially mentioning influencers and communities that advocate for both lifestyle and digital minimalism. This sets the stage for understanding the motivations and practices of minimalists.\n\n3. **Research Gaps**: Highlight why exploring the technological behaviors of minimalists is essential. You’ve mentioned that the intersection of minimalism and technology is underexplored—expand on this to underscore why your research is timely and significant.\n\n4. **Participant Insights**: If you have conducted qualitative research or interviews, consider weaving in some preliminary insights or quotes from participants about their technology use (or non-use) to provide real-world examples that illustrate your points.\n\n5. **Key Themes**: Outline the primary themes or patterns you've observed in the technology usage among minimalists. These could include trends like reducing screen time, the choice of digital platforms that align with minimalist values, and practices like data decluttering.\n\n6. **Implications for Design**: Discuss how understanding minimalist technology use can inform the design of technology products or services aimed at promoting sustainable living. This aligns with the interests of HCI communities and desirable design principles.\n\n7. **Connection to Broader Literature**: Link your findings to existing literature on minimalism and digital behavior. Identifying corresponding studies will strengthen your argument and contribute to a broader academic dialogue.\n\n8. **Transition to Related Work**: Conclude this section by transitioning into the \"Related Work\" section, highlighting how your investigation complements or challenges existing studies on minimalism, technology use, or consumer behavior.\n\nBy refining these elements, you can create a compelling narrative that emphasizes the significance of understanding how minimalism influences technology usage, while also setting a solid foundation for the next part of your paper.",
